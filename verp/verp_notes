Versioning for SLAs
 - only for data -- i.e., size/structure can't change

Versions define a partial order. We define a base version. We guarantee that no
requests will be made for vs < base.

Approach 1:
  - each pointer maintains a (version -> ptr) mapping  using a hash table.
    vptr.get(ver):
	for (v = ver; ; v = v->parent) {
		if ((ptr = mapping.get(v)) != NULL) {
			break;
		} else if (v == base) {
			gc = 1;
		}
	}
	if (gc == 1) {
		mapping.reset() // should decrease reference counts of all versions and call ptr_dealloc() on objects
		mapping.set(base, ptr)
	}

	return ptr;

    vptr.put(vx, px):
	htable.set(vx, px)

   -> also with array, binary search + resize


- Ephemeral versions?

  floorplan will branch a number of versions, make changes and then keep only one.
  We don't need the discarded versions, but for each pointer the version will remain
  in the hash table until  the base pointer surprsases all versions of this pointer

   - A mapping from versions to pointers, would help removing the mappings
   - We might consider ephemeral versions, where the changes are kept externally
     and then commited by actually inserting q

 * check_type - issue a warning or build failure if type is not correct.
 * @expr: the expression whose type we should check (not evaluated).
 * @type: the exact type we expect the expression to be.
 *
 * This macro is usually used within other macros to try to ensure that a macro
 * argument is of the expected type.  No type promotion of the expression is
 * done: an unsigned int is not the same as an int!
 *
 * check_type() always evaluates to 0.
 *
 * If your compiler does not support typeof, then the best we can do is fail
 * to compile if the sizes of the types are unequal (a less complete check).
 *
 * Example:
 *	// They should always pass a 64-bit value to _set_some_value!
 *	#define set_some_value(expr)			\
 *		_set_some_value((check_type((expr), uint64_t), (expr)))
